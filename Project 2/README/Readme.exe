README Text:
This assembly program called 'project2.asm'. The project is designed to make the user interact with prompts asking them to input two numbers,
With the numbers getting added together and printing the sum to the user.

INPUT PROMPTING: The program starts by displaying the message asking the user to enter a number to prompt the user to input the first number
where the user can input any number the user likes, After inputing the user gets asked to input a second number.

ADDITION: Upon recieving the two numbers the program adds them together using simple arithmetic operations.

Output Display: The code prints The sum is but, I couldn't manage to get the output of the 2 numbers to print for both instances
and I have no clue where I went wrong with this.

Subroutine Usage: Additionally, the program demonstrates the utilization of a subroutine named 'Adder 2'. This subroutine takes another 2 
numbers and adds them together but yet again I wasn't able to print the sum of the 2 numbers.

NEWLINE FORMATTING: To enhance readability, the program includes characters after each displayed result.

NORMAL TERMINATION: Finally the program gracefully terminates after completing its task.

To assemble and run the program I followed these steps:
nasm -f elf64 project2.asm -o project2.o
ld project2.o -o project2
./project2
